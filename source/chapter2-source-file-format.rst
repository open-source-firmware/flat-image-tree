Flattened Image Tree (FIT) Format
=================================

Introduction
------------

FIT consists of a devicetree blob with nodes and properties following a certain
schema. Therefore this document defines FIT by providing FDT (Flat Device Tree)
bindings. These describe the final form of the FIT at the moment when it is
used. The user perspective may be simpler, as some of the properties (like
timestamps and hashes) are filled in automatically by available tooling, such
as `mkimage`.

To avoid confusion with the :index:`kernel FDT <pair: kernel; FDT>` the following
naming convention is used:

FIT
    Flattened Image Tree

    FIT is formally a flattened devicetree (in the libfdt meaning), which
    conforms to bindings defined in this document.

:index:`.its`
    image tree source

:index:`.fit`
    flattened image tree blob

    This was previously known as :index:`.itb` but has been renamed to `.fit`.

Image-building procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following picture shows how the FIT is prepared. Input consists of
image source file (.its) and a set of data files. Image is created with the
help of standard :index:`U-Boot mkimage <pair: U-Boot; mkimage>` tool which in
turn uses dtc (device tree compiler) to produce image tree blob (.fit). The
resulting .fit file is the actual binary of a new FIT::

    tqm5200.its
    +
    vmlinux.bin.gz     mkimage + dtc               xfer to target
    eldk-4.2-ramdisk  --------------> tqm5200.fit --------------> boot
    tqm5200.dtb                          /|\
                                          |
                                     'new FIT'

Steps:

#. Create .its file, automatically filled-in properties are omitted

#. Call :index:`mkimage` tool on .its file

#. mkimage calls dtc to create .fit image and assures that
   missing properties are added

#. .fit (new FIT) is uploaded onto the target and used therein


Unique identifiers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To identify FIT sub-nodes representing images, hashes, configurations (which
are defined in the following sections), the "unit name" of the given sub-node
is used as it's identifier as it assures uniqueness without additional
checking required.

.. index:: External data

.. _ExternalData:

External data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIT is normally built initially with image data in the 'data' property of each
image node. It is also possible for this data to reside outside the FIT itself.
This allows the 'FDT' part of the FIT to be quite small, so that it can be
loaded and scanned without loading a large amount of data. Then when an image is
needed it can be loaded from an external source.

External FITs use 'data-offset' or 'data-position' instead of 'data'.

The :index:`mkimage` tool can convert a FIT to use external data using the `-E`
argument, optionally using `-p` to specific a fixed position.

It is often desirable to align each image to a block size or cache-line size
(e.g. 512 bytes), so that there is no need to copy it to an
:index:`aligned address` when reading the image data. The mkimage tool provides
a `-B` argument to support this.

Root-node properties
--------------------

The root node of the FIT should have the following layout::

    / o image-tree
        |- description = "image description"
        |- timestamp = <12399321>
        |- #address-cells = <1>
        |
        o images
        | |
        | o image-1 {...}
        | o image-2 {...}
        | ...
        |
        o configurations
          |- default = "conf-1"
          |
          o conf-1 {...}
          o conf-2 {...}
          ...

Optional property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

description
    Textual description of the FIT

Mandatory property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:index:`timestamp`
    Last image modification time being counted in seconds since
    1970-01-01 00:00:00 - to be automatically calculated by mkimage tool.

Conditionally mandatory property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:index:`#address-cells`
    Number of 32bit cells required to represent entry and
    load addresses supplied within sub-image nodes. May be omitted when no
    entry or load addresses are used.

Mandatory nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:index:`images`
    This node contains a set of sub-nodes, each of them representing
    single component sub-image (like :index:`kernel`, :index:`ramdisk`, etc.).
    At least one sub-image is required.

:index:`configurations`
    Contains a set of available configuration nodes and
    defines a default configuration.


'/images' node
--------------

This node is a container node for component sub-image nodes. Each sub-node of
the '/images' node should have the following layout::

    o image-1
        |- description = "component sub-image description"
        |- data = /incbin/("path/to/data/file.bin")
        |- type = "sub-image type name"
        |- arch = "ARCH name"
        |- os = "OS name"
        |- compression = "compression name"
        |- load = <00000000>
        |- entry = <00000000>
        |
        o hash-1 {...}
        o hash-2 {...}
        ...

_`FIT Algorithm`:

algo
    :index:`Algorithm` name. Supported algorithms and their value sizes are
    shown below. Note that the hash is specified separately from the signing
    algorithm, so it is possible to mix and match any SHA algorithm with any
    signing algorithm. The size of the signature relates to the signing

    ==================== ============ =========================================

key-name-hint
    Name of key to use for signing. The keys will normally be in
    a single directory (parameter -k to mkimage). For a given key <name>, its
    private key is stored in <name>.key and the certificate is stored in
    <name>.crt.

sign-images
    A list of images to sign, each being a property of the conf
    node that contains then. The default is "kernel,fdt" which means that these
    two images will be looked up in the config and signed if present. This is
    used by mkimage to determine which images to sign.

The following properies are added as part of signing, and are mandatory:

value
    Actual signature value. This is added by mkimage.

hashed-nodes
    A list of nodes which were :index:`hashed <pair: nodes; hashed>` by the
    signer. Each is a string - the full path to node. A typical value might be::

	hashed-nodes = "/", "/configurations/conf-1", "/images/kernel",
	    "/images/kernel/hash-1", "/images/fdt-1",
	    "/images/fdt-1/hash-1";

hashed-strings
    The start and size of the :index:`string <pair: strings; hashed>` region of
    the FIT that was hashed. The start is normally 0, indicating the first byte
    of the string table. The size indicates the number of bytes hashed as part
    of signing.

The following properies are added as part of signing, and are optional:

timestamp
    Time when image was signed (standard Unix time_t format)

signer-name
    Name of the signer (e.g. "mkimage")

signer-version
    Version string of the signer (e.g. "2013.01")

comment
    Additional information about the signer or image

padding
    The padding algorithm, it may be pkcs-1.5 or pss,
    if no value is provided we assume pkcs-1.5


'/configurations' node
----------------------

The 'configurations' node creates convenient, labeled
:index:`boot configurations <pair: boot; configurations>`,
which combine together :index:`kernel images <pair: kernel; image>` with their
:index:`ramdisks` and fdt blobs.

The 'configurations' node has the following structure::

    o configurations
        |- default = "default configuration sub-node unit name"
        |
        o config-1 {...}
        o config-2 {...}
        ...


Optional property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

default
    Selects one of the configuration sub-nodes as a default configuration.

Mandatory nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

configuration-sub-node-unit-name
    At least one of the configuration sub-nodes is required.

Optional nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

signature-1
    Each signature sub-node represents separate signature
    calculated for the configuration according to specified algorithm.


Configuration nodes
-------------------

Each configuration has the following structure::

    o config-1
        |- description = "configuration description";
        |- kernel = "kernel sub-node unit name";
        |- fdt = "fdt sub-node unit-name" [, "fdt overlay sub-node unit-name", ...];
        |- ramdisk = "ramdisk sub-node unit-name";
        |- loadables = "loadables sub-node unit-name" [, ...];
        |- script = "script sub-node unit-name";
        |- compatible = "vendor,board-style device tree compatible string";
        o signature-1 {...}

Mandatory properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

description
    Textual configuration description.

kernel or firmware
    Unit name of the corresponding :index:`kernel` or :index:`firmware`
    (u-boot, op-tee, etc) image. If both "kernel" and "firmware" are specified,
    control is passed to the firmware image.

Optional properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

fdt
    Unit name of the corresponding fdt blob (component image node of a
    "fdt type"). Additional fdt overlay nodes can be supplied which signify
    that the resulting device tree blob is generated by the first base fdt
    blob with all subsequent overlays applied.

fpga
    Unit name of the corresponding fpga bitstream blob
    (component image node of a "fpga type").

loadables
    Unit name containing a list of additional binaries to be
    loaded at their given locations.  "loadables" is a comma-separated list
    of strings. :index:`U-Boot` will load each binary at its given start-address
    and may optionally invoke additional post-processing steps on this binary
    based on its component image node type.

ramdisk
    Unit name of the corresponding ramdisk to be loaded at the given location.

script
    The image to use when loading a :index:`U-Boot` script (for use with the
    source command).

compatible
    The root compatible string of the bootloader device tree that
    this configuration shall automatically match. If this property is not
    provided, the compatible string will be
    extracted from the fdt blob instead. This is only possible if the fdt is
    not compressed, so images with compressed fdts that want to use compatible
    string matching must always provide this property.

    Note that U-Boot requires the :index:`CONFIG_FIT_BEST_MATCH` option to be
    enabled for this matching to work.

The FDT blob is required to properly boot FDT based kernel, so the minimal
configuration for 2.6 FDT kernel is (kernel, fdt) pair.

Older, 2.4 kernel and 2.6 non-FDT kernel do not use FDT blob, in such cases
'struct bd_info' must be passed instead of FDT blob, thus fdt property *must
not* be specified in a configuration node.

Mandatory properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

algo
    See `FIT Algorithm`_.

key-name-hint
    Name of key to use for signing. The keys will normally be in
    a single directory (parameter -k to mkimage). For a given key <name>, its
    private key is stored in <name>.key and the certificate is stored in
    <name>.crt.

The following properies are added as part of signing, and are mandatory:

value
    Actual signature value. This is added by mkimage.

The following properies are added as part of signing, and are optional:

timestamp
    Time when image was signed (standard Unix time_t format)

signer-name
    Name of the signer (e.g. "mkimage")

signer-version
    Version string of the signer (e.g. "2013.01")

comment
    Additional information about the signer or image

padding
    The padding algorithm, it may be pkcs-1.5 or pss,
    if no value is provided we assume pkcs-1.5
