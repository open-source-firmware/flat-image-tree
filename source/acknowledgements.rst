FIT (Flattened Image Tree) was developed in 2008 by Marian Balakowicz and
Bartlomiej Sieka of :index:`Semihalf`, under the guidance of Wolfgang Denk,
founder of Denx Software Engineering and creator of U-Boot.

Since then, :index:`FIT` has been maintained and extended by the U-Boot
community to deal with the developing needs of Open Source firmware.

This specification builds on this previous work.

FIT has stood the test of time due to its simplicity and extensibility.
This specification aims to build on this work and provide a means for
further improvement with a wider group of collaborators.
